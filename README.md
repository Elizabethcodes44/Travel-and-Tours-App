- **Theming**: 
- ## üé® Theming

Our Travel and Tours App supports both dark and light themes, allowing users to customize their viewing experience. Here's how the theming works and how you can customize it:

### 1. **Theme Context and Provider**
- **Theme.js** contains a context and provider that manages the current theme (`light` or `dark`).
- The `ThemeProvider` component wraps the entire application, providing the theme context to all components.
- Components can access the current theme using the `useTheme` hook.

### 2. **CSS Classes for Theming**
- The application's styling is handled by CSS and Tailwind classes that respond to the current theme.
- For example, the `bg-gray-900` class applies a dark grey background in dark mode, while `bg-cream` is used in light mode.
- These classes are conditionally applied based on the theme context.

### 3. **Customizing the Theme**
- To customize the theme, you can modify the CSS classes or add new ones in your stylesheet (`index.css` or `App.css`).
- Example:
  ```css
  .light {
    --background-color: #f7f6e7;
    --text-color: #000;
  }

  .dark {
    --background-color: #1a202c;
    --text-color: #fff;
  }
